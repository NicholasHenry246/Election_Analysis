## Election Audit Summary
This script can be used for any future elections and can be modified to other parameters. For example if candidate policies are added to the data file. It is possible to create scripts to determing which policies were most popular among the voters. Another example is being able to determine how many people change candidates or political affiliations in each election. Assuming Charles Stockham wins the next election, if statements man be used to infer how many people switched from Diana Degette and possibly why.
